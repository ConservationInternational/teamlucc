#' Cloud fill using the algorithm developed by Xiaolin Zhu
#'
#' This function is called by the \code{\link{cloud_remove}} function. It is
#' not intended to be used directly.
#'
#' @param cloudy the cloudy image, with pixels in columns (in column-major 
#' order) and with number of columns equal to number of bands
#' @param clear the clear image, with pixels in columns (in column-major 
#' order) and with number of columns equal to number of bands
#' @param cloud_mask the cloud mask image as a vector (in column-major order), 
#' with clouds coded with unique integer codes starting at 1, and with areas 
#' that are clear in both images  coded as 0. Areas that are missing in the 
#' clear image, should be coded as -1.
#' @param dims the dimensions of the cloudy image as a length 3 vector: (rows, 
#' columns, bands)
#' @param num_class set the estimated number of classes in image
#' @param min_pixel the sample size of similar pixels
#' @param cloud_nbh the range of cloud neighborhood (in pixels)
#' @param DN_min the minimum valid DN value
#' @param DN_max the maximum valid DN value
#' @return array with cloud filled image with dims: cols, rows, bands
#' parameter, containing the selected textures measures
